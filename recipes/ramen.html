    <p><h3><strong>Creamy, spicy, umami soup noodles to warm the soul</strong></h3></p>

    <p>This is one of my favourite dishes and always a crowd pleaser. Hearty and satisfying, with mince and slices of pork belly along with al dente noodles and a delectable spicy and creamy broth</p>

<p><H4>Steps:</H4>
    <ol>
        <li>First make the sesame tare. Place all the ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Stir-fry the minced pork in the hot oil until brown, add the other ingredients and carry on cooking until good and dry. Set aside</li>
